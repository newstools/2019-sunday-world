Zimbabwean-born vocalist Charmaine Mapimbiro has jumped off the shy closet to finally make her own mark in the music industry. Mapimbiro – aka Sha Sha, a Shona name which loosely translates to “the best” – said she had been hiding behind well-known artists for
a while and was now ready to break through the music space with her debut elongated play (EP) called Blossom. She said the name was inspired by her courage to finally work on her own album without fear of not making the greatest breakthrough.
The EP had an intimate listening session at La Boqueria in Partktown North prior to its official release on online platforms on Friday. The 25-year-old musician began her career in her home village of Mutare in Zimbabwe in 2014 but has since served as a background singer and featured vocalist for trending Zimbabwean and South African musicians. Mapimbiro gained prominence as the mesmerising voice behind the current hit song Akulaleki by Samthing Soweto, Nge Thanda Wena by Mlindo The Vocalist and Scorpion Kings’ song We Mama. The eight-track EP features her favourite track called Mutare, which she said was dedicated to her home fans who always supported her work. “This is me appreciating people that have always been with me since I started my career in music.
“I wouldn’t have been where I am if it wasn’t for my friends who took my old song called Should I to a radio station in Harare,” she said. She said Blossom was a collection of Afro-soul and amapiano songs which she has recorded in the past months. The project was produced by the self-acclaimed amapiano king Kabza De Small, DJ Maphorisa and Mak Musiq. By Boitumelo Kgobotlo
