Owami Mafokate has stepped her musical career up a notch. She has now added singer to her resume, having started out as DJ. The daughter of kwaito legend Arthur Mafokate debuted her amapiano single, Let’s Get It On, featuring Valentine, on Wednesday. The 18-year-old said the song and genre choice was inspired by her background in kwaito. Although she has been focusing on her matric exams, Owami said she decided to introduce her vocal self this festive season. She believes that is when most people are looking for a new song to vibe to. “At the moment, music is my extra-mural activity after school. Finishing school is my main priority,” Owami said. The promising artist is now toying with the idea of releasing a full-length album next year. “We recorded over 50 tracks since last year and we will choose the best. My dad always told me that the art of being a DJ isn’t playing for yourself but for those around you, so it is important for me to know how to play what people like at any moment,” she said. She said being in the music industry is not a challenge as she is passionate about being an entertainer for the masses. “I feel lucky because my dad makes sure I get a lot of gigs and that makes me happy because I just want to entertain people and do what I love – and because I love travelling, the gigs help me travel a lot,” explained Owami.
