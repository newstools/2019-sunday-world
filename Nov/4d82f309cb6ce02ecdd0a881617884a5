Parties settle on a 5.9% pay rise following bruising battle Cash-strapped national carrier SAA on Friday reached an agreement with unions to end the industrial action, which began more than a week ago and cost the airline R50-million a day. The SAA, the National Union of Metalworkers of SA and the South African Airways Cabin Crew Association agreement means the airline would now restore
a full flight schedule in stages. The warring parties agreed to an increase of 5.9% on total cost of employment retrospective to April 1 2019, which will be paid in the February 2020 payroll, subject to availability of funding. The parties also agreed to establish a task team to identify and consider cost-saving initiatives. Zuks Ramasia, SAA’s acting CEO, said: “This deal, particularly the fact that we offered a 5.9% salary increase amidst grave financial challenges, is to recognise the company’s employees for the important contributions they make to the overall success of the company, economic development, and inbound and outbound tourism.” By Kabelo Khumalo
