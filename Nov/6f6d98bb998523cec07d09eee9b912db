Legendary kwaito musician Doc Shebeleza has been immortalised again – this time through the mega music genre amapiano. Award-winning kwaito and house music producer DJ Cleo has jumped on the amapiano band wagon with his rendition of Doc Shebeleza hit music single titled Gets Getsa, which was remixed by Cassper Nyovest in 2018. Sunday World has learnt that DJ Cleo, real name is Tlou Cleopas Monyepao, fished through his archive of music to remake festive season song. He said he was not migrating to amapiano and that fans should understand that he is an ‘all round musician’ that can never be boxed to one genre. He confirmed that Doc Shebeleza had given him clearance to use his vocals on the song, which he released in the early 2000s. “Yes in 2004 when I first did it [the clearance], and it’s not sampled, he was there and I recorded him…hence he’s endorsing me in the song and saying ‘Weh Cleo’,” Dj Cleo explained. Doc Shebeleza could not be reached for comment at the time of going to press. The new album titled Yile Piano: Volume 1 he features the vocals of late legendary musicians HHP and Brown Dash which he found in his archives. “I spoke to all parties concerned, [HHP’s label, Brian- Dash’s publisher and oldest son]. So happy to honour these legends the best way I know how,” he said. By Nokuthula Zwane
