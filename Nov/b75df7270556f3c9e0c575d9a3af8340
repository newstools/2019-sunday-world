Sifiso Meyiwa, the older brother of slain former Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa, has now taken up the cudgels on behalf of the family to ensure that his killers are brought to book. The keeper died five years ago at his girlfriend’s home in Vosloorus. His father, Sam, had been tirelessly campaigning for his son’s killers to be brought to book, until he died from a stroke three months ago. Sifiso says come hell or high water, this case will be solved. He said his father was never the same after Senzo’s death and now that he is gone, he feels duty-bound to take over the campaign to solve the murder mystery. “There is only one man who shot and killed my brother. I don’t know why authorities have been using their authority and resources to protect this man. I don’t care how much powerful he is, how much money he has. He will be brought to justice. We will ensure that he is arrested and brought down. “We are frustrated with all the shenanigans. We want to know why the NPA [National Prosecuting Authority] and the police don’t bring the culprit to book. They must tell us or allow the AfriForum to take over,” Sifiso said. Addressing mourners during Sam Meyiwa’s funeral in July, Police Minister Bheki Cele said there was progress in the case of Senzo’s murder. He said he had met NPA boss Shamila Batohi to discuss the way forward. Lirandzu Themba, Cele’s spokesperson, said: “Investigations are still ongoing. The police ministry made it clear that with all the hiccups that may be experienced in this case, the case will and must be concluded. We cannot comment on the prosecution [at this stage].” Bulelwa Makeke, NPA spokesperson, told Sunday World that criticism levelled against Batohi and the NPA is unfounded. She said the police handed a “weak” case to the NPA to prosecute. “We felt that the case was not fully and properly investigated and the file was handed back Senzo Meyiwa to the investigators.” By Chris Makhaye
