Finance Minister Tito Mboweni allegedly met slay queen Lerato “Habiba” Makgatho on social media. Sunday World can reveal that Makgatho’s relationship with Mboweni started on Facebook after the struggling actress and model wished the finance minister a happy birthday. That innocent birthday wish later led to inbox messages, with Mboweni allegedly inviting her to come and sing for him. These details were confirmed by Makgatho in an interview with Sunday World last week. She said she met Mboweni in March 2018 and, at the time, she had told herself that she had “hit a jackpot”. She said she felt safe about their relationship because it was discreet as they always met at Mboweni’s apartment in Killarney, Johannesburg. The only issue about her dalliance with Mboweni was that they only saw each other every two months. The young actress first met Gwede “Tiger” Mantashe while waiting for Mboweni at the Sheraton Hotel in Pretoria, where she and Mboweni were to have dinner. In the interview, Makgatho told Sunday World that Mantashe came to her table and complemented her on her beauty. She said the “Tiger” later gave her his business card and told her to contact him on WhatsApp so they could talk. She said when she met Mantashe, she did not know who he was as he was not loud like other politicians. Makgatho said after dating the two ministers for a few months, she started suspecting that they were close and could know she was two-timing them. She said Mantashe later confronted
her and told her he could not share her with Mboweni. “I then decided to end my relationship with Tito, and I started dating Gwede alone.” The ministers decided not to comment.
