The community of Mtunzini in the Kwazulu Natal received an early Christmas gift in a form of a multimillion-rand church building donated by consulting and advisory business Entsika. The 1500-seat church will double as a community development centre during the week – that everyone from the community can access and use. The church was handed over on Sunday.  Zakhele Mkhize, director and founder of Entsika, said the facility was built for all the members of the Mtunzini community, regardless of belief, affiliation or background, “our intention is for this building to act as a focal point for the life of the whole community,” said Mkhize. “this building aims at healing our society by providing a point from which the Mtunzini community can re-build its dignity and purpose, regardless of religious or sectarian beliefs.” The Premier of Kwa Zulu- Natal, Sihle Zikalala was on hand to open the Lutheran Church in the presence of the Right Reverend Molwane Ubane, Presiding Bishop of the Lutheran Church of South Africa.  Entsika is a black-owned and black managed established in 2009.  Some of the group’s clients include government departs, Eskom and the Landbank. By Kabelo Khumalo
