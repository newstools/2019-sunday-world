AKA aims to fill up the Durban ICC. Local rapper AKA will be taking his music to his much loved fans of eThekwini for the second installment of his orchestra concert. A concept that kicked off this year, AKA will team up with the KZN Philharmonic Orchestra and DJ Tira’s company Afrotainment to bring the musical concert to life. AKA, real name Kiernan Forbes, is expected to fill up the Durban ICC Arena with more than 12 000 people on November 2. “I am excited to be bringing my orchestra show to the city of eThekwini. This is my favourite city in the world to perform in. I love the energy of the people, they show love and it’s so easy to reciprocate,” said AKA.   Bongani Tembe, the chief executive and artistic director of the Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra and the KZN orchestra, said the orchestra made a lasting impression on the rapper. The orchestra consists of 70 musicians. By Nokuthula Zwane
