TNS used her voice without her approval Afro soul singer Berita has called house music producer TNS to order for using her vocals on a song without her approval. Berita, whose real name is Gugulethu Khumalo, this week blasted the Umona musician for using her voice in a song, Qina, she thought was meant for Prince Kaybee. She threatened, in a hot tweet, to take legal action against him if he did not make the move to fix the mess. “@TNSMusic you have disrespected me greatly by using my vocals on your album prior to my consent. I’ve reached out to you but no returned calls from you. Should I not hear back from you by the end of the day, I will let my lawyer make the call,” she wrote. Sunday World made attempts to contact TNS, whose real name is Nkazimulo Ngema, but he laughed and hung up.  According to a source close to the musician, TNS, who was working with Prince Kaybee at the time, was also working with Berita at the time the song was recorded. “If you recall this is the TNS that was working with Prince Kaybee and they split up. Berita thought she was recording for Prince Kaybee [and] this was before they split up. Next thing TNS has Berita in his album,” said the source. Speaking to Sunday World, the Ndicel’ikiss singer confirmed TNS did call her back and they have decided to resolve the matter out of court.
“My wish is that DJs can be respectful of the singers and songwriters they work with. It’s very important for them to respect copyright
and get written consent prior to releasing the work. As well as to properly credit and share publishing splits with the songwriters,”
she said. She said when a song becomes a hit, it is often the DJs who profit while the songwriters are left with nothing to show for it. “DJs must stop being greedy and start sharing royalty income properly.” By Nokuthula Zwane
