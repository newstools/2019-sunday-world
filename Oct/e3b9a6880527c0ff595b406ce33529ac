DA wants answers from the minister State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo could face an investigation by the inspector-general of intelligence, Setlhomamaru Dintwe. This is after Dianne Kohler Barnard, who is the shadow minister on state security for the DA, filed a complaint with Dintwe, following a fallout between Dlodlo and her State Security Agency (SSA) domestic branch head, Advocate Sam Muofhe. Barnard has written to Dintwe to investigate whether Dlodlo issued an illegal instruction to Muofhe to monitor the communication of a man during the xenophobic attacks in early September without an order from a judge. “Given the almost daily reporting on what looks to be a virtual Cold War in terms of security matters, I find this utterly unacceptable. As such I have been moved to write to you, express my concerns, and ask that you investigate these matters,” she wrote. “If indeed the minister instructed Advocate Sam Muofhe, the newly appointed head of the State Security Agency (SSA’s) domestic branch, to monitor the communication of a man in early September, without an order from a judge, then that would, in my opinion, be a criminal act,”
she added. Dintwe acknowledged Barnard’s complaint, saying “kindly be advised that the matter is under consideration and we will revert to you in due course”. Barnard has also written a parliamentary question to Dlodlo, asking her to confirm if she did issue the instruction. Insiders in the SSA close to Muofhe, who is an ally of President Cyril Ramaphosa, told Sunday World the president had made a mistake by appointing Dlodlo to the sensitive portfolio. Dlodlo is believed to be close to former president Jacob Zuma and ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule. Dlodlo’s spokesperson Mava Scott said the department would pursue those in the agency who leaked the information. By George Matlala
