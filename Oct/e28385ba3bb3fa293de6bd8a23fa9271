Soul Candi’s Spring Fiesta festival has received a major boost in the form of cider brand Hunter’s which has come forth as sponsors of the event that is set to rock the City of Ekurhuleni today. The 2019 revamped event now christened Hunter’s Spring Fiesta has been running for eight years. The popular spring event hosted at Wild Waters began as a Soul Candi Live music concert and has developed into a movement and lifestyle along the years. But this year’s vibe cannot be compared to another. Following the new partnership, the event introduced change in their hip hop stage which will now be hosted by PH. It does not end there – the hours have also extended to accommodate the newly introduced after party at Nicci Beach inside the venue, but general ticket holders will need to pay extra fees for entry. This year’s international headliners are: Frank Roger, Osunlade & Karizma, Monique Bingham and Lars Behrenroth. Popular local musicians who will grace the event include the likes of Kabza De Small, A-Reece, DJ Fresh and Lebza De Villain. Da Costa says he is excited to still be relevant after nine years of continued passion to keep local and international patrons entertained. “There are a few things that we have changed this year, there is a big Amapiano feature and SF 2019 as well as a mapping experience on the main stage. “We’re excited to bring you a production experience that is going to blow your mind. If you thought our 37m high butterfly was impressive, wait ‘til you see what we have planned for the real headliners, the fans,” says Da Costa. By Boitumelo Kgobotlo
