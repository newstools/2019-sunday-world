Media personality Lerato Kganyago is showing the gay community some love this pride month. The stunner posted her rainbow clad body on social media to show her allyship to the LGBTI community. The picture landed just as the world celebrated Botswana's decriminalisation of homosexuality on Tuesday in a landmark ruling.
