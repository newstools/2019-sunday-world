The Black First, Land First (BLF) and all the people who celebrated the death of four pupils and those injured after a walkway collapsed at HoÃ«rskool Driehoek in Vanderbjlpark are moegoes. How can the BLF be so insensitive, so cruel? The BLF also said it will not be taking any disciplinary action against its spokesperson Lindsay Maasdorp for her twitter celebrations.
