She will share the stage with the first lady of Sierra Leone Fatima Maada-Bio, who will be honoured with the Warrior Award. American actress Tiffany Haddish will take home the Roar Award. "It's always a positive validation to be celebrated for your contribution to the entertainment industry. I see it as a moment to implore others to do their part in making the world a better place; I'm so humbled," said Mbatha. She said the awards aim to celebrate  women of the African diaspora who continue to spread  positivity in people's lives. Mbatha is also nominated at the South African Film and Television Awards in the Best Actress category for her  role as Thandeka on Mzansi Magic's Isibaya.
