A police officer will apply for bail in the Bellville Magistrate's Court in Cape Town on Tuesday after he allegedly forced a woman to perform a sexual act to avoid arrest. "It is alleged that on February 17 about 4pm, the victim was approached by an unknown white male at 1st Avenue in Bellville. The unknown male was driving a private car and he introduced himself as a police official to the victim," said Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) spokesperson Moses Dlamini. He told the victim he could arrest her for prostitution and then forced her to perform the sexual act. "The suspect, who is a police officer, was arrested by the police after being pointed out by the victim." The victim had recognised the police officer while she was laying a complaint about the incident at a police station. After his arrest, Ipid took over the case.
