An ANC heavyweight is being accused by a Joburg woman of drugging and raping her in the apartment of his businessman friend in Sandton last year. The explosive claims came to the fore after the 28-year-old woman wrote a letter to ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule last week, which was leaked to Sunday World. In the letter, the woman complained about the top gun, who cannot be named for legal reasons. After studying the letter of complaint, Magashule summoned the top dog to his office at the ANC headquarters, Luthuli House in Joburg, and handed the letter to him. Magashule allegedly phoned the victim and asked her what she wanted him to do with her complaint. Get a copy of Sunday World to read more
