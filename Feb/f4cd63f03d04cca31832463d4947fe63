Don't allow load-shedding to spoil the romance this weekend. You don't need electricity to create these very delicious dishes. Rainbow jar salads Salad: 2 cups rocket leaves 1 cup cucumber, diced 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved 1 cup red onion, roughly chopped 1 cup pineapple, chopped 1 can black beans 1 can lentils or 1 cup couscous For the dressing: 1/3 cup rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoons honey 1 teaspoon Dijon or whole grain mustard 3 tablespoons cooking oil Salt and ground black pepper to taste Whisk all dressing ingredients together and pour evenly into the mason jars. For the salad: distribute the ingredients evenly among the five jars, starting with couscous and finishing with the rocket leaves, creating layers. Keep dressing at the bottom with denser salad vegetables to keep items crisp and to avoid sogginess.
