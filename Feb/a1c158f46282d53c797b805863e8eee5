Now that the year is in full swing, resolutions involving weight loss and detoxing are high on everyone's to-do list. My favourite detox is adding smoothies to my diet as meal replacements. Detox smoothies are a refreshingly easy and tasty way to flush your body of toxins and reset the body. This is much needed after all the gluttony that was festive eating. Detox smoothies usually contain fresh vegetables and fruit with yoghurt or water. Make sure to add all your favourites to cram in vitamins, antioxidants, fibre and other healthy nutrients to both flush and hydrate the body.
