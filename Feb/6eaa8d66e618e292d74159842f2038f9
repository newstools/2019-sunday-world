With Kaizer Chiefs' 2018 Nedbank Cup campaign having ended in humiliating fashion, the club is looking for redemption this time around. It was arguably one of the lowest moments in the club's history, who can forget that Chiefs fans went on the rampage at the Moses Mabhida Stadium after losing to Free State Stars? The consequences of that seismic result saw coach Steve Komphela being fired and the club re-evaluating the future after three trophyless seasons . Chiefs are once again in the semifinal of the competition, but they have to go through Cape Town City, who edged them 1-0 in the league last month. Midfielder George Maluleka saysAmakhosi are still not over that loss to City. "Considering the last result, revenge would be sweet," Maluleka said. "From the way we're playing, we show a lot of character. It's a chance to redeem ourselves." The Citizens have been in impressive form, winning four of their last five games in all competitions. "City are doing well at the moment but we haven't been too bad either. We will reflect on our mistakes from last time." With about 10 games left, the Glamour Boys are still within touching distance of log leaders Bidvest Wits and Sundowns. Maluleka, 30, insists that his team is not out of the title race and "it's not over until it's over". "It's a little early, I believe it will go down to the last day. We feel it's still possible and if you as a player do not believe that then you are with the wrong team."
