Most women love and own many bags and toys, but there are those who are willing to pay a fortune for them, writes Somaya Stockenstroom Luke Calitz, owner of Luxity, South Africa’s largest source of pre-owned, authenticated luxury, says fashion houses like Louis Vuitton and Gucci are popular and can even reach up to six-figure retail prices. However, the most expensive available handbag in South Africa at the moment is a pre-owned Hermès Birkin bag valued at R190 000 at their store. He says the Hermès Birkin has usually reached the top of the list since its creation in 1984. “Customers in South Africa are very lucky as they are the only ones on the continent, with one or two exceptions, who have direct access to brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada,” says Calitz. Other expensive bags, according to Luxity, are the Louis Vuitton Ostrich Leather Alma PM, which costs R135 000 at Louis Vuitton boutiques, Louis Vuitton Limited Edition Artycapucines PM by Nicholas Hlobo at R132 000, the Gucci Limited Edition Elton John Dionysus Shoulder Bag (R89 000 at Gucci boutiques), and the Louis Vuitton Quilted Lambskin Capucines PM (R82 000).
