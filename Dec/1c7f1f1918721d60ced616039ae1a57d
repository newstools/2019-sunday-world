Cassper Nyovest’s #FillupRoyalBafokeng homecoming edition was nothing short of magical, but comes with a few costs to his pocket. According to the rapper’s manager Lerato ‘Tlee’ Moiloa, the world class production cost over R 8. 3 million with additional random expenses. Moiloa clapped back at a fan who wished to relive  the fifth installment of Nyovest’s #FillUp concerts at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, North West on Sunday. Moila said: “Brother that stage is R8 300 000,00 with additional random costs. Crew of 50 per shift to build, 2 x shifts per day, u cater & provide accom for all. 7 days straight. Basically min cover charge has to be R600 for 15 000 capacity venue just for stage. Snongonongo ha se dumele  Cassper Nyovest gave a three-hour performance that was authentically African, choreographed, and world-class visuals and sound production. With three hair changes – from blonde to orange to pink, custom made wardrobe, a performance with his father, a tribute to the late HHP and a action call for men to do better and against gender-based violence, Cassper Nyovest raised the bar high. “I couldn’t have asked for a better homecoming! The best birthday present ever! We’re doing it again next year. Thank you, Rustenburg!” said he said, shortly after the show. By Nokuthula Zwane zwane@sundayworld.co.za
