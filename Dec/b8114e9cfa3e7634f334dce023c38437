Amanda Black says she is a Nubian queen who has reclaimed her power. This after a two-year struggle in the music industry. Relishing the success of her new album, Power, the singer, whose real name is Amanda Antony, will be the headline act at the annual Nubian Festival at the Eagle Waters Wildlife Resort on December 13-16. She explained that her latest songs will be at the forefront of her performance during the festival. “I called the album Power because it is the title track and basically summarises the messaging throughout the album. It means standing up for myself and that I acknowledge I have a voice and finding the courage to use it.” Speaking to Sunday World this week, she said her denition of Nubian means royalty and embracing heritage. “I’ve just simply embraced my heritage and have the desire to represent my culture in everything I do,” she said. A fashion statement she has taken ownership of is her signature- beaded, wig which she calls a “blue beadoo”. She said she will rock it proudly at the North West festival because it’s “representative of African culture”. The Amazulu singer has been in the music industry as a recording artist for three years, but has built her profile of drawing in crowds as a stage performer for eight solid years. She said the journey was never smooth sailing. She had a public breakup with her former record label Ambitiouz Entertainment. She says there was a point when she felt “hopeless and powerless”. She is now an independent musician with her own record label, AfroRockStar. The singer has claimed national recognition as afrosoul royalty and has shared the stage with the likes of Lira, Judith Sephuma and Ringo Madlingozi. By Nokuthula Zwane
