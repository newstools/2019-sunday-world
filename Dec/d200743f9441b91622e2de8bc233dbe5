The South African Police Service (SAPS) has finally made a breakthrough in the multi-million rand corruption at Eskom, arresting yet to be named erstwhile Eskom managers for R745 million misused in the construction of Kusile power station. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said former Eskom senior managers were arrested over alleged fraud and corruption. He added that more details around the arrests will follow during the course of the day. Eskom chairperson and acting CEO Jabu Mabuza early this year said the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) is investigating the alleged theft of R139 billion from Eskom, related to the construction of the Medupi and Kusile power stations. Standing Committee on Public Accounts members last month visited both Kusile and Medupi power stations amid the ongoing problems of nationwide load shedding, billions of rands of irregular expenditure, and alleged corruption.
