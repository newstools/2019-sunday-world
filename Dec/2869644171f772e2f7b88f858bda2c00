SABC deputy board chairperson Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi is embroiled in another scandal, this time involving her double remuneration from two government- owned entities. It has emerged that Mohlala- Mulaudzi, who is also CEO of the Estate Agency Aairs Board (EAAB), an entity of the Department of Human Settlements, has been receiving remuneration from both the SABC and EAAB. Sunday World understands that the department, through one of its offcials, Jan Maritz, queried Mohlala’s remuneration with SABC board chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini in a letter dated October 17, to establish whether the CEO had violated the law. Responding in a letter dated November 1, Makhathini confirmed she was being paid, but said the payments were stopped at the end of September. He said Mohlala-Mulaudzi was, however, prepared to reimburse the SABC if it was found that she was not supposed to be paid for her work as a board member. “She did, however, indicate to the SABC’s company secretary in August that she is seeking clarity on the matter but that remuneration should be terminated in the meantime, and that payments will be refunded where needed,” reads Makhathini’s letter. Asked why the department wrote to the SABC about Mohlala, departmental spokesperson Mandulo Maphumulo said the department wanted to establish the facts. “This is after engaging with Ms Mohlala-Mulaudzi on the matter upon realising that she was a board member of the SABC. The oversight and monitoring work is standard procedure for the department on its entities,” she said. When contacted last week for comment on how much is at stake, Mohlala-Mulaudzi said she needed time to check her bank records before responding. A week later, she declined to comment on the figure but said she had done nothing wrong. “I wish to state on record that there is no impropriety on my part. I stopped the payment of the board fees of my own volition long before there was any query from any third party. Further, I wonder why the board has continued to pay board fees to other board members who are clearly public servants and then single me out in the letter, even though for the past five months I have not received any board fees from SABC, after stopping them personally whilst awaiting clarification and advice.” Mohlala-Mulaudzi’s lawyer Pule Malahlela of PJ Mathebul Attorneys said there was no provision in statute regulation or policy prohibiting Mohlala- Mulaudzi from getting paid by two entities. He said Mohlala-Mulaudzi’s appointment as CEO of EAAB was regulated by the Estate Agency Affairs Act, and she is drawing a salary from
EAAB, which is not a government- owned entity, but is listed as a public entity under the PFMA. He said Sunday World was conflating the legal position in respect of public service officials who are prohibited by the Public Service Act from getting any remuneration for serving on the boards of state-owned entities. “We invite you to look and inquire into whether circumstances such as our client does not exist within both the current SABC and the Estate Agency Affairs Board members,” reads the attorney’s letter. Makhathini confirmed the letter but said it was sent directly to the Department of Human Settlement, and he does not understand how it got to be in the hands of a journalist. By Aubrey Mothombeni
