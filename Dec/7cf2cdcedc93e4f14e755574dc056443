Jo-Anne Reyneke continues to ride the wave of success aer she  jumped the sinking Isidingo ship. Although she claims not to have foreseen the 22-year-old soapie sinking, she walked away from the Lungi Biyela character in June this year. Sunday World has learned that she was to return to the soapie on December 6 2019, according to a press release. But the show has offcially
been canned. “I did not foresee the end of Isidingo, I thought it would last forever,” she said this week. Reyneke briefly swapped her acting hat for that of presenter on the reality show Single Parents Looking for Love. The show, which is nearing the end of its run on the Viacom channel, sees one single parent contestant go through three potential suitors. Reyneke said that she related to the content because of her own experience. This follows her break-up with the father of her children, actor Thami Mngqolo, who played Senzo on Generations: the Legacy. The wit of the show lies in the introduction of a panel of young children who ask the single parents who are potential partners tough questions and give their parent feedback based on their interaction. “I was very excited to be on the show on a platform as prominent as BET Africa for my presenting debut, particularly because it is a subject close to my heart and I found myself relating a lot with our single parents. “This is a show that is driven by love and a bit of humour, a show the whole family can watch together and enjoy. You will laugh, cry and be filled with joy at seeing people’s lives play out on your screen,” said Reyneke. She has hopes that there will be a second season and that more single parents will find their happily ever afters. But as it draws to an end this month, Reyneke has already found herself another gig. This time as a comedian in the sitcom Blacktax. “I never stopped acting. I was acting on two other productions the whole time. I just never announce before I appear on screen, which may be tomorrow,” she said. By Nokuthula Zwane
