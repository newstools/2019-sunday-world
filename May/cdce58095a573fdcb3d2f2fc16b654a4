The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) are a bunch of moegoes for having apparent weak systems to prevent double voting. This comes after the IEC confirmed more than 20 people had been arrested for "multiple voting". How could the IEC drop the ball by not ensuring their systems including their indelible ink are unbreachable? Inefficient moegoes.
