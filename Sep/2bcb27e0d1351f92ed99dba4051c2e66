Netsianda shares stage with big guns. It’s a hot Saturday afternoon at the Royal Heritage Festival in Thohoyandou, and Venda’s 15-year-old rapper Tsianda Netsianda, popularly known as Jack Bunny, is bouncing from wall to wall after his hyped performance. Netsianda warmed up the crowd with his single Heklakwee ahead of a hectic line-up featuring various hot acts including AKA, Sho Madjozi, Sjava and Zakes Bantwini. Inspired by the likes of Bomo Unlimited, Mizo Phyl, Percy Mukwevho and armed with words of encouragement from his teachers and fellow pupils from his school, Netsianda was all confident as he ascended the stage. “They prayed for me on Thursday at school saying that I have to do good and represent them well,” he said. “I am excited and feel honoured for the opportunity to share a stage with the likes of AKA ,” he said.
Netsianda, who raps in his mother tongue Tshivenda, and has been rapping since he was 10, was performing for the second time at the annual festival that took place at the picturesque Nandoni Dam. The young artist said he wanted to preserve his heritage and culture. He said his plans include working on his debut album and he is looking for the right people to execute his vision.
