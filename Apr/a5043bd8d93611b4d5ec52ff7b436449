Joburg City mayor Herman Mashaba's refusal to address protesting residents of Alexandra makes him a moegoe of enormous proportions. He said he was way "too busy governing Johannesburg" to make time to address the residents, angered by lack of service delivery and land grabs. The moegoe fuelled the situation by sending MMC for public safety Michael Sun instead. Sun was booed during his visit.
