Radio and TV sports presenter Robert Marawa added more awards to his bulging collection after bagging two trophies from the Liberty Radio Awards last night. The Metro FM and Radio 2000 presenter was given a nod as the best sports presenter and shortly after the moment, his weekly simulcast sports radio show Marawa Sports Worldwide received the best sports show award. The 46-year-old broadcaster, who rejoined the SABC in the middle of last year after leaving the public broadcaster under controversial circumstances, dominated the sports category during the event that was held at the Sandton Convention Centre. Beverly Maphangwa, who produces the Marawa Sport Worldwide show, lost out to 947 Breakfast Club producer Khetha Mkhize. Lesedi FM's Monate Breakfast Show, which airs from 6.30am to 9am, was awarded the best breakfast show award. An Afrikaans community radio station based in Welkom, Free State, grabbed the most loyal listeners award.
