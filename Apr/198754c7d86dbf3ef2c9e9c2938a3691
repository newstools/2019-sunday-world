The 25th Oppikoppi music festival in the mining district of Northam, Limpopo, will not take place this year - after the 2018 event was ruined by criminals targeting attendees. The 2019 event would have taken place between August 8 and 10, but the organisers have decided that the cost of the necessary security would make ticket prices too high. They hope to bring the event back next year after reviewing their options. "This was a very big decision for us," said Theresho Selesho, CEO of Matchbox Live, owners of the festival, said in a statement on Thursday. "For 24 years, Oppikoppi has been going great guns. Unfortunately in 2018 we experienced the rampant crime currently impacting events and festivals across South Africa. "For us to present the 2019 event with the increased security measures that are required to curb this crime, to present a safe and enjoyable festival, the production costs also increase drastically. "By taking a gap year, we are giving ourselves the breathing room to redesign the festival and bring in the necessary changes without impacting the festival-goer by increasing ticket prices." Selesho saidÂ in doing this, the organisers are investigating bringing the festival to a venue closer to a major city to enable day tickets. "All options are open. Nothing is out of question," he said. On the event's Facebook page, music lovers have shared their safety concerns. Here is a snapshot from recent months:
