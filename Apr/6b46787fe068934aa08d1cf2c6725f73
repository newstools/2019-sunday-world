Nearly forgotten ex-Kaizer Chiefs dribbling wizard Mthokozisi Yende may be past  his heyday and finding it difficult to find a top-flight club again, but his sturdy physique is still  hot property. Yende, now on the books of Gauteng ABC Motsepe League side Baberwa, is now juggling his football in the third tier of South African football with modelling, thanks to his well-built body. "I am also doing modelling, it's going nicely. I am also doing ads ... I am being booked everywhere. But still my soccer career comes first," said the media-savvy Yende. The lad from Tembisa on the East Rand shot to stardom during his days at Chiefs between 2009 and 2012. It was his educated left foot that endeared him to the Amakhosi faithful. Without spilling the beans, Yende implied that he's been doing well financially despite plying his trade in the third tier. The 34-year-old  thinks keeping a low profile has helped him a lot amid his struggle to find a team in the elite league. "It's about keeping your life very private ... you are never going to be exposed on how you lived before compared to how you're doing now. I have been up and chilled ... I've been cool, man, doing my things on the side," insisted Yende. With his unique talent, it goes without saying that a lot was expected from Yende (when he was still in PSL) and that he really never reached his full potential. However, the former AmaTuks ace believes it was God's plan that his career turned out the way it did. "I am not surprised because you know,  God does things in His own way. So it was never a setback but a learning curve," noted the Baberwa  midfielder. "I still do have ambitions to play in the  PSL but my immediate goal is to take this team to the next level, which is the National First Division. I felt the love from day one here."
