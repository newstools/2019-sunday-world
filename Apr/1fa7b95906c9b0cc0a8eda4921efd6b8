ANCYL members involved in the thrashing and disruption of the launch of Pieter-Louis Myburgh's book Gangster State are moegoes of the first degree. Acting like thugs, the league members disgustingly tore copies of the book alleging corruption by ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule at a Sandton book store.  Stop acting like morons.
