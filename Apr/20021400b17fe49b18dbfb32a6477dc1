Unemployed male nurse Bongani Khunjwa is our charmza for taking time to assist a pedestrian bleeding on the side of the road after an accident. Khunjwa, who was driving home from jogging and was only equipped with a small first aid kit, helped minimise the bleeding from the head before the victim was taken to hospital. The charming Khunjwa has been receiving praises for playing the good Samaritan.
