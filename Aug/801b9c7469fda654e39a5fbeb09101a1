Scandal! actress Mokokobale Makgopa has gushed over dark-skinned actresses in the industry that have broken barriers and made it easier for her to pursue her dream of acting. Mokokobale, who plays the role of Selewa on the hit e.tv soapie, said representation in the industry was important, especially for those who could feel marginalised because of their skin tone. "Something amazing happens when you watch stories that reflect your lived experience. There is something magical about seeing someone who has the same hair as you have, the same dark tone that you have, represented on national TV," she said, noting that she was inspired by actresses such as Grace Mahlaba, Masasa Mbangeni and Brenda Ngxoli. "As a little girl, watching these women who look like me opened the possibilities of me being on national TV as a dark-toned actress. It opened up the realisation that I have a voice and can be heard." She said that while the industry was becoming more welcoming of different skin tones, too often people limit themselves and allow stereotypes to decide what they can, and cannot, do. Her comments come as the conversation around colourism continues to hog the headlines. Pearl Thusi and Bonnie Mbuli had a heated twar two months ago over "light-skinned privilege" and Beyonc√© released a song called Brown-skinned Girl. A Nigerian woman identified as Maj divided Twitter after singing her version of the song titled Light-skinned Girls. - TshisaLIVE
