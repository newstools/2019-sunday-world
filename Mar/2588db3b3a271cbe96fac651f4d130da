Shwa had a lovely brunch at the luxurious Munro Boutique Hotel for the launch of LUXâ€™s new Even Tone campaign with her fellow sisters. Some girls are just born lucky. The face of the campaign Nandi Madida was a glowing beauty with her rose-gold hair and fuchsia dress. She is heavily preggos and ready to pop any day now, but she looked better than everyone in the room.
