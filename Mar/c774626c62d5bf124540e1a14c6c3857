A club official in Polokwane is facing a police investigation for a gun slinging incident after a match in the ABC Motsepe League. Polokwane Academy assistant coach Thabo Tlouane opened a case this past week against Pusela City official Tornado Mafumo for threatening the team with a gun after the match. Tensions flared at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium after Polokwane Academy edged Pusela City 4-3 last weekend in the third tier. "After the scuffle that everyone saw inside the field, I went onto the tunnel and that guy took out a gun and started pointing at everyone who was there, including me," Tlouane said. He said Safa should provide security at league matches as similar incidents were also happening in other provinces. "It's becoming dangerous." In another incident, referee Mongezi Phungula was badly assaulted by a mob from ABC Motsepe League team Summerfield Dynamos in Chatsworth, Durban. A video clip that trended on social media shows Phungula being assaulted by a group of people. Unlike the National First Division, the ABC Motsepe League is run by Safa and not the Premier Soccer League. Safa has vowed to come down hard on team officials engaging in criminal behaviour after the two incidents. Head of referees at the association Tenda Masikhwa says tough action will be taken against any wrongdoers. "I'm meeting the officials from that game and they will give me a report of what happened," Masikhwa said.
