The Competition Commission is our lovable charmza for investigating anti-competitive deals between schools and exclusive suppliers of school uniforms and coming up with a solution. The commission has spelled out a broad co-operation agreement between the schools and uniform suppliers to adopt transparent procurement deals going forward. We hope from now school uniforms will become affordable for all.
