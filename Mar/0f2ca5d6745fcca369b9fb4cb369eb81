Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is in no doubt who should be crowned the Premier Soccer League's (PSL) Midfielder of the Season when the award is announced at the end of the campaign. He says Sundowns skipper Hlompho Kekana, 33, is most deserving of an award that has eluded him despite winning three Absa Premiership titles in the last five seasons. "Kekana shows his maturity - he shows why he is my midfielder of the year. I know every time when it is the PSL awards he doesn't get it," Mosimane said. "Everybody pops up and gets midfielder of the year and he has been a contester for five years, so who has gone five years with him? Nobody! He doesn't win it, he's just nominated." Mosimane insisted Kekana kept showing his credentials above the local game too. "He is doing it for Bafana, big time. I mean really, when you see Kekana, you ask yourself - who is going to replace him?" Last season Kekana captained Sundowns to the league title but lost out to Siphesihle Ndlovu for the Absa Premiership Midfielder of the Year crown.
