While most of his football peers are flaunting "Vrrr -Phaahs" and all material things associated with fame and fortune, budding SuperSport United midfielder Sipho Mbule has resisted following the glamour trail. Not only is Mbule showing his modesty by using public transport, despite having the means to buy his own car, the 20-year-old star also stays at a club house in Laudium, Pretoria, with some of his Matsatsantsa's MultiChoice Diski Challenge teammates. "I do have a driver's licence but I won't rush to buy my own car. I'm living a simple life, [like] an ordinary 20-year-old. "Yes, I can afford a car but I am doing things at my own pace," said Mbule. The former Amajita international has a special bond with his family, admitting that sometimes he gets homesick and hardly spends a day off in Gauteng. Mbule is close to his teammate and homeboy Teboho Mokoena as they both hail from Bethlehem, eastern Free State. "I love my family. They all live in Free State. Most of the times I miss home but when we get some time off, I make sure I don't sleep in Gauteng. I go straight to Free State even if it's for one day. "When I am at home, what I enjoy the most is going to church with my mom [Mmatumane Mbule]. Going there always heals me spiritually. "We come a long way with Tebza [Mokoena]. We were groomed at the same academy (Harmony Academy in Free State). We like to go shopping together, and watching movies. We are also staying together in Laudium."
