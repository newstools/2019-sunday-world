Award-winning hip-hop juggernaut Cassper Nyovest is probably rewriting the verse in his popular song Monate Mpolaye from "monate ompolayela eng" to "Sars ompolayela eng". Sunday World can exclusively reveal that the SA Revenue Service (Sars) filed court papers against Cassper's company Family Tree Media for allegedly failing to settle a whopping R3.6m bill for unpaid income tax.
