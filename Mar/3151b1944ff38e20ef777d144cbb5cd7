Award winning DJ and producer Kabelo Motsamai, popularly known as Prince Kaybee, celebrates the townships in SA with his latest single, called Gugulethu. The single forms part of his latest studio album called Re Mmino, released this week. "I thought that for us to be on radio, it's better to work on a song with a catchy hook. Indlovukazi murdered that hook and we had a song. "The piano on the song accommodates her voice," said Motsamai. Apart from Afro jazz musician Indlovukazi Mculo, Gugulethu also features producers Supta and Afro Brothers. According to Motsamai, the songwriting ability by Indlovukazi made the song an anticipated hit. Though the title of the track is inspired by the Cape Town township of the same name, Motsamai said the song was for township life in general. "Gugulethu, in this case, was chosen to represent all townships and that life in the township is not as bad as people make it out to be," he said. It's a good surrounding of people, there is a lot of respect there. Kasi is pretty dope, which is what we are trying to emphasise on the song." The ten-track album was launched at a listening session to give his dedicated fans a preview of what to expect. Celebrities such as Kenny Kunene, Heavy K, Tresor, Mobi Dixon and Miss Pru attended. During the listening session friends and fans howled for the replay of Gugulethu. The song is indeed a crowd pleaser, which follows the sounds of the lead single on the album, Fetch Your Life, featuring soulful musician Msaki. At the session, he cleared allegations by former co-producer TNS that he had produced nine tracks on the album after the two had a major fallout last month. "When I see this boy, I see myself. He is talented. but all the tracks on my album I did myself and co-produced."
