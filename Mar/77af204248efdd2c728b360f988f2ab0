Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan joined celebrities including model Naomi Campbell and singer Liam Payne on Wednesday at an event celebrating young peopleâ€™s involvement in bringing about positive social change. Over 12,000 students and teachers also attended WE Day UK at the SSE arena in Wembley, London. Harry gave a speech and was later joined on stage by his pregnant wife, who made a surprise appearance after not originally being expected to attend. All attendees at WE Day were selected after completing a year-long school citizenship programme championed by WE co-founders and brothers Craig and Marc Kielburger, who opened the event alongside Harry. Harry has previously spoken at the 2014 edition and also at WE Day Toronto in 2017. His older brother Prince William and wife Kate meanwhile, were braving the rain in the northern seaside town of Blackpool where they visited the landmark beachfront tower and watched a display of ballroom dancing.
