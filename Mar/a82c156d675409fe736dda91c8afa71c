Koos "The Great Last Warrior" Sibiya has heaped praises on the  BSA board for stamping its authority by ordering a rematch against SA junior-lightweight champion Phila Mpontshana. Mpontshana was declared the winner in the fight against Sibiya after  a debatable decision  in East London in July last year. Trainer Ncedo Cecane says Mpontshana will send the 37-year-old  into  retirement in their eagerly-awaited rematch, to be staged by Rumble Africa Promotions at Nangoza Jebe Hall in Port Elizabeth next Sunday, April 7. "BSA has shown its authority and all praises to the board for making sure that this fight happens because those who watched it will attest to the fact that I suffered an away loss to the champion in his back yard," said Sibiya, from Mpumalanga, who is trained in Johannesburg by Bernie Pailman. "Mine is to go inside the ring and do my job." Mpontshana is from Mdantsane. Pailman said: "We outsiders get a raw deal in  East London. Hopefully, this will not be the case this time. We are going to PE with all our guns cocked and ready to do harm." But Cecane said: "Koos is an old man. Fortunately it is the SA champion that will send him to old age." Azinga "Golden Boy" Fuzile will defend the IBF Intercontinental title against Mexi can Romulo Koasichia. Victory for Fuzile will bring him closer to fighting for the actual IBF belt that is held by Tevin Framer. Ayabonga  Sonjica and Asiphe Ntshili will fight for the vacant ABU junior-featherweight title. SuperSport will broadcast the eight-bout card live from 2pm .
