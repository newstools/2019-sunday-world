What wedding gift do you get the man who seemingly has everything, including the world at his feet? Well, what about moolah for his honeymoon? That is what Kwesta and his bae asked those attending their white wedding for this past weekend. The multi award-winning muso and his missus Yolanda celebrated their white wedding surrounding by family and friends. The pair tied the knot in a traditional ceremony last year but waited until now to have their dream white wedding. The couple and their guests couldn't help but gush over the ceremony and shared some of the moments on social media. Reflecting on the big day, Yolanda said she had married her best friend. "Yesterday I married my best friend. So many people to thank, I’ll get through it I promise. For now I just want to thank my husband for choosing me. I love you Mr Vilakazi," she wrote on Instagram. Here are just five things that gave us #WeddingEnvy: The star-studded guestlist included Kid X, LootLove and Reason, Tshepi Vundla and her bae JR. Kwesta looked dapper in a white suit with a black trimming, but it was Yolanda who really impressed with a strapless gown and beautiful veil. While some guests no doubt brought physical gifts, according to one of the guests, Kwesta's business partner Nhlamulo Baloyi, the bridal couple simply asked for people to add to their their honeymoon fund so they could enjoy some sun. Is there anything more magical than this? Of course, what would a wedding be without loads of beautiful pics to put on your wall and show off?
