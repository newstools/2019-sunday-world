Our charmza is hero Vincent Cosa for risking his life to rescue a boy stuck halfway on a pipe over the Jukskei river in Alexandra. The boy found himself on the pipe because he usually saw other children playing in the area but when the storm hit, he sat there alone crying in fear. When Cosa reached him, he convinced him to get on his back, before carrying him to safety. Well done Vincent, you are a true hero.
