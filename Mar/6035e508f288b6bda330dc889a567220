Has-been vixen Tumi Voster was the host and what a yawnfest. Whispers in the corridors is that she got Pearl Modiadie's sloppy seconds. Pearl pulled out due to her commitment of hosting the Saftas. Woooooo shem! Tumi was so boring that Somizi started a whole hot conversation in the background with his pals that was more va va voom than her hosting skills. The disrespect though Somgaga.
