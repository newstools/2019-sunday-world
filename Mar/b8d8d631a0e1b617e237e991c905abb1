Veteran midfielder Reneilwe Letsholonyane will be leaving SuperSport United at the end of the season when his contract expires. Letsholonyane has had a successful stint at the club since his arrival from Kaizer Chiefs in 2016 - winning the Nedbank Cup and the MTN8 in 2017. The former Jomo Cosmos player has made three appearances in the club's last 10 league games. Overall the midfielder affectionately known as Yeye has made 11 appearances in their 24 league games. The 36-year-old still feels that he can play regularly at a high level and will look for game time elsewhere. The SuperSport management, on the other hand, felt that the veteran should rather choose another role in the coaching ranks. Club chief executive Stan Matthews confirmed that Yeye was on his way out. "Yeye will be leaving at the end of the season," Matthews said. "He is a true professional and has been fantastic for the club. He feels he still has a couple of years left to play and we don't see it like that. "We would have wanted him to shift his focus more to the coaching side and life after football but he has told me personally that he has one or two more seasons to go. "Having made a contribution at SuperSport the door is always open  for  him to come back and play a part in our structures." The club is planning to promote some young  midfielders from the academy to the senior team to replace Letsholonyane. "We are not going to replace him with someone from outside. We will open up a spot for some of our youngsters like Luke le Roux, Jamie Webber, Kamohelo Mahlatsi, Oswin Appolis and Sipho Mbule," Matthews said.
