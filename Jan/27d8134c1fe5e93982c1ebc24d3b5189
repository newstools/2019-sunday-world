When he's not on the soccer field, Nhlanhla Vilakazi unwinds by listening to deep house music at home. Vilakazi is an avid lover of the genre that he pumps from his car and new house in Durban. "I enjoy deep house music a lot because it is very relaxing and I like to play it when I'm chilling at the house," Vilakazi said. "Also it depends what kind of mood I am in because sometimes I can play some hip-hop, but deep house is [my] number one." The 31-year-old relocated to KwaZulu-Natal following his transfer from Free State Stars to AmaZulu last year. But the industrious midfielder from Watville, Benoni, has ties to eThekwini as it is the hometown of his wife Nqobile. "My wife grew up here and my kids love it also so I like it here. Everything is going well and we are happy here," he said. "My kids are in school here [after relocating from Joburg] and they enjoy the beach very much." The Usuthu skipper is a true family man - a trait he picked up back home in Benoni while growing up in a family of eight children. The father of three (one daughter and two boys) is about to expand his brood soon as his wife is set to give birth next month. "We have a bundle of joy on the way. I think it may come around my birthday on 25 February," he laughingly says. The former Mamelodi Sundowns academy player is also giving back to his community after launching the Nhlanhla Vilakazi Sports Academy late last year in Benoni. "The participation in sport is dying back home so I just want to inspire the kids to play, not just football [but] all sporting codes," concluded the player who also played for Bay United, Ajax and Maritzburg United.
