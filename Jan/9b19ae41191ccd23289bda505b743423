With the January blues and the festive money spent - you can save on your weekly dishes by using Sunday's leftovers. With meat, it's important to store correctly - when it's at room temperature (ideally within 90 minutes) pop it in the fridge. You can safely store cooked meat for up to three days in the fridge, or in the freezer for two months. Make sure that it's fully defrosted before using, and if it's been frozen once, don't refreeze.
