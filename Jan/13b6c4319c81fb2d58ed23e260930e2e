The snakeskin trend is officially out of control. Khanya Mkangisa and Nomzamo's sister Wendy Mbatha had a bad case of "B**ch Stole My Look" by showing up in the same style. They passed it off as twinning, but it was awks. Even wore the same see-through shoes. Thought we left the plastic shoe trend in 2018 gals.
