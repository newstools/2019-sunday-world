Big-ups to the Limpopo-based SA Youth Choir, also known as the Ndlovu Youth Choir, for reaching the finals of the TV show America's Got Talent. The judges, including the show's critical creator Simon Cowell, had nothing but praise for the group as they performed Shakira's 2010 World Cup song, Waka Waka, this week. The audience was left spellbound by their latest offering. Good luck for the next round and fly the Mzansi flag high, charmzas.
