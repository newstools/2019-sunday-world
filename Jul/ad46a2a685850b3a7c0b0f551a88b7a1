On paper Orlando Pirates may appear to have made the best signings, but are they the right players to help them win the 2019/2020 Absa Premiership? Bucs have been the runners-up in the last two seasons, with Mamelodi Sundowns winning it on both occasions. While the Brazilians have been quiet in terms of player recruits, Pirates had snapped up 10 players at the time of writing. Questions have been raised on a few areas in Pirates' team, especially in goalkeeping, defence and striking departments. In response, Pirates have beefed up their squad by signing French goalkeeper Joris Delle, who was previously on the books of Dutch outfit, Feyenoord. They haven't done much in defence with only left-back Bongani Sam coming in from Bloemfontein Celtic. In attack, Gabadinho Mhango has joined from Bidvest Wits. All these players may not come in and hit the ground running. Mhango, for example, played just 12 league games and scored a paltry three goals for the Clever Boys last season. Whether Pirates have done enough remains to be seen and the answer would come at the end of the season to see if they finally get the better of Sundowns. Sundowns, however, are no ordinary team with players like Hlompho Kekana and Gaston Sirino in their ranks. Pitso Mosimane's charges will kick off their season with a home clash against neighbours SuperSport United on Saturday. Pirates host Bloemfontein Celtic the same day. Pirates' archrivals Kaizer Chiefs will also be looking to challenge the Tshwane side for the coveted league crown. Amakhosi, like Pirates, have been trophyless for a number of seasons and would be desperate to celebrate their 50 years of existence - formed in 1970 - with some silverware. Wits, Cape Town City and SuperSport United will undoubtedly also fancy their chances in the title race. Meanwhile, Polokwane City will also be under the spotlight. From the signings across all the teams, the one thing that's evident is that most appear to have done good business.
