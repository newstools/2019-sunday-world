The City of Cape Town councillors and mayor Dan Plato are a bunch of moegoes for proposing to arrest and fine the homeless in the city. How do they expect homeless people  to pay the fines? Now the council has made a U-turn, saying the fines will be restricted to homeless people committing criminal acts. The homeless have rights too, moegoes.
